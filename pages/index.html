                        <p>One of the major problems experienced at many high schools currently in Kenya is on dropout cases due to various reasons such as teenage pregnancy, early marriages, child labour and so on.</p><br>
                        <p>Therefore, the aim of this service is in tracking those who have dropped out so as to be used as a means to help them to return to school. Scroll down to get more details on the service.</p>
